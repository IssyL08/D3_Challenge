          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income (2014 Census Data)</h2>
          <p>To see different data relationships, select from the headings: Poverty, Age, Household Income, Obesity,
            Smokers, and Without Healthcare. Each selection will change the State data represented in circles on the graph.
            The small circles can then be selected or use the mouse to hover over, to view the state values.  </p>

         <p>The graph represents three groups of data relationships, each showing powerful correlations. The first
           group is the "Percent in Poverty" demographic as it relates to three distinct risk factors: percentage  
           of obesity, percentage of smokers, and  percentage without healthcare. The second group is the "Median Age"
           demographic as it relates to to three distinct risk factors: percentage of obesity, percentage of
           smokers, and percentage without healthcare. The third group is the "Median Household Income" demographic
           as it relates to three distinct risk factors: percentage of obesity, percentage of smokers, and percentage without healthcare.  </p>
